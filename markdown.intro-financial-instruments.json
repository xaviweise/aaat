This convention proved practical for cross-border lending, allowing banks to align loan pricing with their own funding costs. As syndicated lending expanded in the 1970s and derivatives markets emerged in the 1980s, LIBOR was formalized by the British Bankers’ Association (BBA) as a standard daily benchmark, calculated as the average rate at which major banks believed they could borrow from one another on an unsecured basis.","position":{"start":{"line":132,"column":1},"end":{"line":132,"column":1}},"key":"lsG9g5B0wK"}],"key":"jnluAxJJjj"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":134,"column":1},"end":{"line":134,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"However, the credibility of LIBOR was deeply undermined during the LIBOR manipulation scandal uncovered between 2011 and 2012.

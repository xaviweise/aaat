# Financial Markets

## Introduction

Financial markets are a solution to a problem perennial to our
societies: the efficient channelling of savings into productive uses.
Legal and natural persons who have excess cash seek to obtain the maximum returns (investment) with the maximum availability (liquidity).
Therefore, they would prefer to lend money short - term. Those however who need cash in order to fund their ventures (new companies, new business plans for existing companies, acquisition of assets like houses via mortgages, social programs, etc) prefer to pay the minimal
compensation possible and retain the funds for long-term. The lack of a mechanism to be able to accommodate those opposing objectives might lead to a society where excess funds remain idle instead of being channeled to productive uses.

Modern capitalist societies solve this problem in two ways, which form the backbone of the financial system: the banking system and financial markets.

### The Banking System

In the banking system the center is the bank, an institution or private company that offers short-term deposits with high availability to those
with excess funds, and long-term loans to those who need funds. A capital cushion based on short-term loans or directly cash is maintained in order to fulfills withdrawals. Their activity is not exempt from
risks:

-   liquidity risk, which can happens if the demand to withdraw deposits
    exceeds the capital cushion, and depositors cannot be satisfied
    (bank run)

-   credit risk, which happens when borrowers of funds default on their
    obligations and don't give back those funds.

Banks compensate those risks by charging a spread between interest of
loans and interest of deposits, on top of a margin to pay for their
operations. The banking system has traditionally being the central core
of the financial system in Europe.

### Financial markets

In financial markets, those who need funds issue financial instruments,
legally binding contracts that articulate the terms in which those funds
will be returned to the investor, as well as the compensation for the service. So far that is not that different from traditional banking loans. The key for financial instruments is the possibility of
transferring the property of the contract, i.e. the right to receive back those future cash-flows and compensations. This provides a mechanism for the lender to potentially recover the funds before the
contract ends, solving the problem of liquidity even if contracts are
issued with long-term horizons.

Of course, for that the lender needs to find a counterpart that is willing to purchase the financial instrument, and agree to the price.
Pricing financial instruments is however not a simple task, since their value depend on assumptions about the certainty of those future cash-flows (for instance, what if the borrower cannot commit in the future to pay back?). There are also considerations of opportunity costs, since the potential investor will necessarily compare the return
on its investment when acquiring the financial instrument with other potential productive uses of her money. Financial markets developed precisely to solve these two problems: 1) finding counterparts, 2) setting a price.

Financial markets are the place where interested parties meet and negotiate the prices of financial instruments. In **primary markets**, financial instruments are issued by the borrowers and acquire initially by investors, sometimes via intermediaries like banks. In **secondary
markets**, already issued financial instruments are negotiated between investors, with the original borrower not playing any part any more in the process. Most of trading nowadays occurs in secondary markets.

In this process, financial markets not only provide of a mechanism for investors to obtain liquidity from their investments, but also serve as a mechanism for price discovery. In the end, in financial markets (as in
other markets), the price of a financial instrument is what two willing parties agree to transact, independently of the subjective value that each of them place on the instrument. Of course, by pulling multiple investors in the same place to negotiate, financial markets channel multiple speculative ways about the value of a financial instrument into
an actual price. These prices can guide investors about future
decisions.

Certainly! Here's an expanded version of the section while maintaining the main ideas:

## Who Participates in Financial Markets?

Financial markets primarily involve **legal entities**, although **natural persons**—individuals—may also participate, typically through intermediaries such as **banks** or **brokers**. The core participants issuing financial instruments are varied: **corporations** issue securities to fund their business activities, while **governments** at all levels—local, regional, national, and supranational—issue bonds to finance social programs or public investments. Additionally, **banks** design and issue customized products aimed at meeting the investment needs of institutional and individual investors.

On the demand side, **institutional investors** such as hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance companies play a crucial role in acquiring financial instruments. Their goal is either to generate returns for their clients or manage specific risks. **Corporations** also buy financial instruments, both to make their excess cash productive and to hedge against business risks. Similarly, **banks** acquire these instruments as part of their liquidity management strategy, to generate returns on customer deposits, and to mitigate various financial risks. **Central banks** are key participants as well, utilizing financial instruments to execute their monetary policies, influencing money supply and interest rates.

In terms of intermediation, **banks** and **brokers** facilitate market transactions. **Banks**, particularly in their role as market-makers, are key **liquidity providers**. They stand ready to buy or sell financial instruments, profiting from the **spread**—the difference between the buying and selling price—which compensates them for holding the instrument until an opposing counterparty emerges. **Brokers**, on the other hand, connect buyers and sellers through their networks or proprietary platforms, charging a fee for their matchmaking services without holding the financial instruments themselves.

An increasingly important role in financial markets today is played by **new liquidity providers**—technology-driven financial firms. Many of these firms originated from **high-frequency trading** and now use advanced algorithms to provide liquidity in electronic markets. This new breed of liquidity providers competes with traditional market-makers, leveraging automation and sophisticated trading strategies to ensure tighter spreads and more efficient markets.

## Types of Financial Instruments and Asset Classes

Financial instruments are the building blocks of financial markets, representing the contracts or securities through which money flows. These instruments are typically grouped into distinct **asset classes** based on their characteristics, the types of returns they provide, and the markets they operate within. Understanding the different types of financial instruments and asset classes is essential for comprehending how financial markets function and how participants make investment decisions.

The major asset classes include **equity**, **fixed income**, **money markets**, **derivatives**, **foreign exchange (FX)**, **commodities**, and **cryptocurrencies**. Each asset class plays a distinct role in the financial ecosystem, catering to different investor needs, risk appetites, and financial goals.

### Equity and Fixed Income

The most well-known financial instruments are **stocks** and **bonds**, which form the foundation of two major asset classes: **equity** and **fixed income**.

- **Stocks** represent ownership in a corporation and give investors a claim on a portion of the company's assets and earnings. Stocks are part of the **equity asset class**, providing potential for capital appreciation and dividends. However, they also expose investors to market volatility and business risk, making them a relatively high-risk, high-reward investment.
  
- **Bonds**, on the other hand, are debt securities issued by governments, corporations, or other entities to raise capital. Investors in bonds lend money to the issuer in exchange for periodic interest payments and the return of the bond's face value at maturity. Bonds belong to the **fixed income asset class**, which generally offers stable and predictable returns, although they are still subject to risks such as interest rate fluctuations and credit defaults.

Both stocks and bonds are often referred to as **cash instruments**, meaning their value derives directly from the underlying market dynamics, without the need for an intermediary asset.

### Money Markets

Within the fixed income category, there is a sub-sector known as the **money market**, which some consider an asset class of its own due to its distinct features. **Money market instruments** are short-term debt securities that typically mature in less than a year, such as **Treasury bills**, **commercial paper**, and **certificates of deposit**. These instruments are highly liquid and relatively low-risk, making them an attractive option for institutions and governments looking to manage short-term liquidity needs, as well as for investors seeking a safe place to park cash temporarily.

### Derivatives

**Derivatives** are financial contracts whose value is derived from the performance of an underlying asset, index, or rate. They can be based on a wide range of underlying assets, including stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, and interest rates. This is why some categorize derivatives within the asset class of the underlying instrument, though they are often considered an **asset class** of their own due to their unique characteristics.

Derivatives are versatile and serve several purposes, such as **hedging** risks, **speculating** on price movements, or **leveraging** positions. Common types of derivatives include **futures**, **options**, **swaps**, and **forwards**, each offering different structures and risk profiles. For example, a company might use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates or commodity prices, while a trader might use options to speculate on the price of a stock.

### Foreign Exchange (FX)

The **foreign exchange (FX)** market is a critical component of the global financial system, where participants trade currencies. Transactions in the FX market are generally categorized as either **spot** or **derivative** transactions.

- **Spot transactions** involve the immediate exchange of currencies, typically settling within two business days. While FX spot transactions are essential for international trade and finance, they are not classified as financial instruments under **MiFID II**, as they do not involve contractual obligations extending beyond the settlement period.
  
- FX **derivatives**, such as **forwards**, **options**, and **swaps**, are used to hedge currency risk or speculate on currency movements. Unlike spot transactions, these contracts involve specific obligations between parties and are therefore considered financial instruments.

FX markets are used by a wide range of participants, including **central banks** (to manage currency reserves), **corporations** (to hedge currency risk in international operations), and **investors** looking to profit from currency fluctuations.

### Commodities

**Commodities** are physical goods such as oil, gold, and agricultural products, traded primarily in spot markets. These goods themselves are not considered financial instruments, as they represent tangible assets rather than financial claims. However, the **derivatives** based on commodities, such as **futures** and **options on commodities**, are classified as financial instruments. These contracts enable investors to gain exposure to commodity price movements without needing to take physical delivery of the underlying goods, providing opportunities for hedging and speculation.

### Cryptocurrencies

**Cryptocurrencies**, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are a relatively new and rapidly evolving **asset class**. Unlike traditional financial instruments, cryptocurrencies do not represent contractual obligations or financial claims. Instead, they function as digital assets, leveraging **blockchain technology** to provide decentralized and transparent transactions. Their value is driven by supply and demand dynamics, making them highly volatile compared to other asset classes.

Although cryptocurrencies themselves are not classified as financial instruments under existing regulatory frameworks, **derivatives on cryptocurrencies** (such as Bitcoin futures) are considered financial contracts. These derivatives allow market participants to speculate on or hedge against the price movements of cryptocurrencies, much like they would with other asset classes.

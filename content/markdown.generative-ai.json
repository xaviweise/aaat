Human beings are the benchmark for Artificial Intelligence, as the famous test proposed by Alan Turing in 1949, the imitation game, clearly showcases. Here, a human evaluator tries to differentiate the human and the machine in a text transcript of a natural language conversation between them. The machine passes the test if the evaluator cannot tell them apart with certain confidence. There are naturally many domains where human intelligence is quite limited, for instance when working with raw datasets trying to generate statistical inferences. A Turing test where one of the participants is able to extract patterns from a billion lines dataset will provide a clear hit to the evaluator on who is the machine.

These systems were based on a large corpus of rules compiled from experts in a specific field, the idea being that these systems could be used to reason about new problems in those domains.

Neurologists now understand that human brains generate such abstractions by building or strengthening connections between neurons in our brains when exposed to regularities in perceptions. It does not come then as a surprise that the most successful machine models were built upon neural networks, that resemble at a high level the workings of the brain.

Central to this approach is the concept of the time value of money, which states that a payment received in the future is not economically equivalent to the same payment received today, due to opportunity costs. As a result, future cash flows must be converted into present values through the application of a discount factor, which renders cash flows occurring at different points in time comparable.","position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":1},"end":{"line":12,"column":1}},"key":"XN6eezw9Zv"}],"key":"TbmM3sJWJ1"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":1},"end":{"line":14,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Time discounting, however, is not the only challenge faced by fundamental valuation models. Future cash flows are frequently contingent on information that is not known at the valuation date, such as future prices of financial assets or macroeconomic variables. Examples include dividends paid by a company or the value of the underlying asset referenced by a derivative contract. A simple, albeit theoretically naive, approach consists in valuing the instrument as the expected value of its future cash flows, treated as random variables. This approach, however, fails to account for heterogeneity in investors’ risk preferences. Once cash flows are stochastic, the realized return on the investment becomes uncertain, and uncertainty is not valued equally by all investors.

In particular, it is useful to analyze the hit & miss, i.e. the ratio between won RfQs over the total traded by the client with any dealer (i.e. excluding those where the client did not trade at all), over a certain window of time. Intuitively, a dealer that has an abnormally high or low hit & miss might be using an incorrect fair value estimation from the quoting. Of course, the tricky question here is to assess what are the normal levels of hit & miss, which have to take into account the influence of factors like, for example, inventory levels in the spreads quoted: if a dealer has relatively high inventory holdings, it is likely that she will skew quotes to reduce inventory risk, hence the hit & miss will be higher if there are more quotes overall in the direction of risk reduction.","position":{"start":{"line":489,"column":1},"end":{"line":489,"column":1}},"key":"Lldpmd3DW8"}],"key":"nYwiY001g7"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":491,"column":1},"end":{"line":491,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"If the dealer has estimated a model that estimates the probability of winning the RfQs, and the model is well calibrated, it can be evaluated for the same windows of RfQs as the empirical hit & miss (H&M).

The Kalman filter model uses point estimations of the correlations for the updates, and therefore ignores the potential uncertainty associated to the estimation when updating the price. This issue can actually become quite relevant in certain situations, for example when estimating the price of illiquid instruments using more liquid ones. The liquid instrument will have a smaller estimation error than the illiquid one. If point correlation between the instruments is high, it can have a over-weighted influence on the estimation of the price of the illiquid instrument, overriding the intrinsic price dynamics of the illiquid instrument.

This kind of behavior is better capture by using utility functions, as we will discuss in the next section.","position":{"start":{"line":561,"column":1},"end":{"line":561,"column":1}},"key":"o93Oc6VVGK"}],"key":"FNdECJFmUD"},{"type":"heading","depth":3,"position":{"start":{"line":563,"column":1},"end":{"line":563,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The utility indifference theory of fair value estimation","position":{"start":{"line":563,"column":1},"end":{"line":563,"column":1}},"key":"lPAIrQIxCU"}],"identifier":"the-utility-indifference-theory-of-fair-value-estimation","label":"The utility indifference theory of fair value estimation","html_id":"the-utility-indifference-theory-of-fair-value-estimation","implicit":true,"key":"ugyBferTQI"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":565,"column":1},"end":{"line":565,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"To ground the discussion in another example, let us consider a specific case of a future uncertain cash-flow whose value depends on the price of another instrument at the time of payment, ","position":{"start":{"line":565,"column":1},"end":{"line":565,"column":1}},"key":"VtpY84koBC"},{"type":"inlineMath","value":"S_T","position":{"start":{"line":565,"column":1},"end":{"line":565,"column":1}},"html":"<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>S</mi><mi>T</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">S_T</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.05764em;\">S</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.3283em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0576em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">T</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","key":"ra1wkry7DK"},{"type":"text","value":", for example a stock.

These models allow us to get sometimes closed-form solutions, but more realistic models that capture better empirical distributions of prices can be used.","position":{"start":{"line":567,"column":1},"end":{"line":567,"column":1}},"key":"ms2GmtmwC0"}],"key":"OYevmRBcPE"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":569,"column":1},"end":{"line":569,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"As mentioned in the previous section, we cannot just value this cash-flow using the expected value of the pay-off, since it would ignore the risk-profile of the investor.

first main differences is, as commented, the dependence with respect to the risk-free interest: in BSM theory, the premium is more valuable as interest rates increase, wheres in utility indifference

As interest rates grow, the opportunity cost of investing the premium for the future cash-flows of the options increases, since a risk-free deposit generates comparatively a larger yield. In other words, for an investor, the option becomes less attractive and is willing to pay less for it.

As mentioned before, if both were to value the option as an investment, there would be no agreement on the premium to pay, since they hold opposite sides in the trade. However, if the dealer uses BSM theory there is room for agreement, at least for those investors whose expectations on market drifts make the premium requested by the dealer attractive.

Whereas a less frequent re-hedging increases the dispersion of the residual, those are still unbiased and symmetrical. Other violations produce skewed distributions with non-zero mean. When introducing transaction costs, residuals have a negative mean, meaning that the BSM premium is insufficient to cover the actual costs of replication, as expected since the BSM derivation does not take into account such transaction costs. The effect of a different dynamics for the underlying is more nuanced: depending on the actual process, the distribution of residuals might have positive or negative mean, meaning that the BSM premium over-estimates or under-estimates, respectively, the costs of replication. For instance, if the realized volatility is lower than the one used for pricing and hedging in the BSM model, the mean of the residual is positive. This is, again, intuitive, since as we seen the premium of the option increases with volatility, so overestimating it means charging a larger premium than necessary for replication. Notice that this is not necessarily good for a dealer in competition, since if other dealers have a better estimation of market volatilities, they will be able to offer more competitive prices to clients and close more

It is actually not difficult to generalize this result to time-dependent deterministic interest rates ","position":{"start":{"line":1068,"column":1},"end":{"line":1068,"column":1}},"key":"PIQTyEWuPr"},{"type":"inlineMath","value":"r_t","position":{"start":{"line":1068,"column":1},"end":{"line":1068,"column":1}},"html":"<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>t</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">r_t</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.5806em;vertical-align:-0.15em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.02778em;\">r</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.2806em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0278em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\">t</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","key":"QwGpsSd0jO"},{"type":"text","value":".

The implied volatility is the one obtained by inverting the BSM formula given prices observed in the market, assuming for instance that there is a set of standard options that are traded in an exchange. In the first years of application of the BSM theory to price options, around the 1980s, this had the consequence of having very small premiums for options, particularly put options, with strikes very deep out-the-money (i.e. far from the underlying price at the time of quoting). This was a consequence of a Gaussian assumption on price returns, that predicted a very low probability of such options being exercised. In 1989, such prediction was contradicted when the market dramatically crashed, forcing dealers to readjust the prices with respect to the BSM formula. Multiple models such as local or stochastic volatility models, or models with jumps in the dynamics, have been proposed later to address these issues. One point to bear in mind is that the logic applied in the BSM framework can be still applied when introducing these more complex dynamics, and deterministic premiums can be derived as far as we add extra instruments in the hedging portfolio that allows the dealer to neutralize those risks (stochastic volatility, jumps, etc)","position":{"start":{"line":1163,"column":1},"end":{"line":1163,"column":1}},"key":"NnLcqRJviC"}],"key":"CnJiLb8Sh0"}],"enumerator":"2","key":"VTmfMhm5Xm"}],"key":"c8sYI434FX"}],"key":"iZ3z5oLrLu"},"references":{"cite":{"order":["Cochrane2005AssetPricing","gueantMidPrice","sinclair2010option","guo2017quantitative","black1973pricing","merton1973theory","joshi2003concepts","wilmott2007introduces","evans2010partial","BrigoMercurio2006","AndersenPiterbarg2010a","AndersenPiterbarg2010b","Vasicek1977","HullWhite1990"],"data":{"Cochrane2005AssetPricing":{"label":"Cochrane2005AssetPricing","enumerator":"1","html":"Cochrane, J.
